# ACTIVITY OVERVIEW

In this activity, you will create an incident report using the knowledge you’ve gained about networks throughout this course to analyze a network incident. You will analyze the situation using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF). The CSF is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. Creating a quality cybersecurity incident report and applying the CSF can demonstrate a proactive approach to security, improving communication and transparency with stakeholders, and improve security practices within your organization. You can also add the incident report you create to your cybersecurity portfolio when  you complete it.

The CSF is scalable and can be applied in a wide variety of contexts. As you continue to learn more and refine your understanding of key cybersecurity skills, you can use the templates provided in this activity in other situations. Knowing how to identify which security measures to apply in response to business needs will help you determine which are the best available options when it comes to network security.

## SCENARIO

You are a cybersecurity analyst working for a multimedia company that offers web design services, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions to small businesses. Your organization recently experienced a DDoS attack, which compromised the internal network for two hours until it was resolved.

During the attack, your organization’s network services suddenly stopped responding due to an incoming flood of ICMP packets. Normal internal network traffic could not access any network resources. The incident management team responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets, stopping all non-critical network services offline, and restoring critical network services. 

The company’s cybersecurity team then investigated the security event. They found that a malicious actor had sent a flood of ICMP pings into the company’s network through an unconfigured firewall. This vulnerability allowed the malicious attacker to overwhelm the company’s network through a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. 

To address this security event, the network security team implemented: 
1. A new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets
2. Source IP address verification on the firewall to check for spoofed IP addresses on incoming ICMP packets
3. Network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns
4. An IDS/IPS system to filter out some ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics

As a cybersecurity analyst, you are tasked with using this security event to create a plan to improve your company’s network security, following the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). You will use the CSF to help you navigate through the different steps of analyzing this cybersecurity event and integrate your analysis into a general security strategy. We have broken the analysis into different parts in the template below. You can explore them here:

1. Identify security risks through regular audits of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges to identify potential gaps in security. 
2. Protect internal assets through the implementation of policies, procedures, training and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats. 
3. Detect potential security incidents and improve monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections. 
4. Respond to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents; implement improvements to the security process. 
5. Recover affected systems to normal operation and restore systems data and/or assets that have been affected by an incident.

### ACTIVITY

#### SUMMARY: While working as a cybersecurity analyst at a multimedia company that offers different marketing solutions to small businesses, we expericed a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that compromised the internal network for two hours. During the attack network services suddenly stopped responding due to an incoming flood of internet control message protocol (ICMP) packets, and as a result all network resources we're disrupted. Due to the ICMP spam normal traffic could not access any network resources. After reviewing the network traffic, and realizing what was happening, the incident management team blocked all ICMP packets. In doing so they stopped all non-critical network services affline, and restored critical network services. After the cybersecurity team investigated the event. They found that a malicious actor had sent a flood of ICMP pings into the company's network through an unconfigured firewall. This vulnerability allowed the malicious actor to overwhelm the company's network through a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. In this event a malicious actor targeted the company's network and flooded their servers with ICMP packets. The perpetrator of the attack is someone who had access to multiple devices and used them to orchistrate a distributed denial of service attack. The attack affected not only the company and its employees, but also the customers who relied on the company's internal network, for two hours.

#### NIST CSF CORE 5 FUNCTIONS:
1. IDENTIFY: In this event the company was the victim of a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. A DDoS is a type of network disruption that occurs when multiple devices are used to overwhelm a target system, such as a server or network, by sending many information requests repeatedly in a short amount of time. in doing so the attacker is able to disrupt and disable critical network functionality. Because of the flood of network traffic the network is unable to be accessed by customers and employees that rely on its critical infrustructure and services, and therefore we have a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. The internet control message protocol is a network layer communication protocol used to determine weather two network enabled devices can communicate. ICMP is also used to relay information regrading the success of that communication.
2. PROTECT: This attack disrupted critical network services that both employees, and customers of the company use. Anyone who has access to the network firewall, and admin panel should be aware of this configuration error. By properly configuring the network firewall to restrict the amount of ICMP packets sent and recived over the network an attack like this can be prevented. It's possible that IP obfuscation could also help prevent an attack like this in the future. By obfuscating the IP of the company network it would be more difficult to orchistrate an attack of this scale. Because the internet control message protocok (ICMP) is a criticial network function and cannot be outright disabled it's best practice to limit the amount of ICMP messages that can be sent and recieved so that an attack of this nature (DDoS) cannot take place in the future.
3. DETECT: The IT staff at the company could use a security information and event management (SIEM) tool that is configured to detect and alert to abnormal network traffic, such as the traffic demonstrated in this attack, to detect and prevent an attack like this in the future. In doing so it would allow the incident response team at the company to more quickly rectify the issue with the network and restore critical network functionality. The team could also impliment an intrustion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) to filter out certain ICMP packets with suspicious characteristics. Both of these tasks help automate the process of detecting and blocking malicous network traffic, and creates a more quick incident response time.
4. RESPOND: In order to recover the affected systems it may be necissary to block all network traffic coming from unknown or untrusted sources temporaly. Often it can be difficult to differentiate legitimate traffic from malicous, and blocking all unwanted traffic allows us to still access any critical network functions we may need. It may take some trial and error to correctly configure these network tools to work to defend the company's network. The company would benefit from conducting a penetration test or pen test, or hiring a third party to conduct one on their behalf.
5. RECOVER: After implimentation of better firewall configuration, SIEM tool configuration, and IDS/IPS configuration, the network security team at the company should regularly monitor the network for similar traffic patterns to the ones seen during the attack. Once the incident response team has found the source of the attack, and blocked or restricted access to the network by the provocateur, network operations can be returned to normal.
