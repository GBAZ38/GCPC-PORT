<P>I AM MOST INTERESTED IN LEARNING ABOUT PEN TESTING AND WEB EXPLOITS. I ASPIRE TO BECOME A BUG BOUNTY HUNTER SO THAT I CAN CREATE A SAFER INTERNET.</P>
<P>THIS DOCUMENT IS MEANT FOR ME TO REFER BACK TO WHENEVER I FEEL LACK OF MOTIVATION, STUCK, OR DIRECTIONLESS. THIS DOCUMENT IS ALSO INTENDED FOR POTENTIAL RECRUITERS, EMPLOYERS, AND MY PEERS TO READ AND GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF MY SKILLS AND GOALS.</P>
<P>THE SKILLS I HAVE GAINED AS A MANAGER ALLOW ME TO BETTER WORK WITH A TEAM, AND EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE WITH MY PEERS. I HOPE TO UPHOLD THE SECURITY AND PRIVACY OF THE INTERNET BY LEARNING MORE ABOUT WEB EXPLOITS AND APPLYING WHAT I LEARN TO BE A BUG BOUNTY HUNTER.</P>
